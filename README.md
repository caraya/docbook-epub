This website supports my ebook Ebooks: From Docbook to ePub and Kindle too. It includes the following files:


* __build-full.xml__: A full Ant buildfile for Docbook documents.
* __build.xml__: ePub specific Ant buildfile
* __build-no-if.xml__: Same as build.xml but without using the optional if and associated tasks
* __docbook-howto.xml__: Docbook file for the book
